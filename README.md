# Overview:

This project is an overlay that shows emote streaks on the bottom left of the page. **_(Page dimensions are 1280px x 720px)_**  
It can also show emotes randomly on screen if a chatter does !showemote (*emote_name*)  
*This overlay can be used in streaming software like OBS*   
The emotes are taken from Twitch, FFZ, BTTV, and optionally, 7TV.

This project took direct inspiration from pajlada's pajbot, although I believe my version is easier to setup and use.
